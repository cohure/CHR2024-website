            dm4myth aims to bring together researchers from various disciplines who are interested in studying myths with digital tools and methods.
            We welcome contributions from various disciplines, such as (but not limited to) Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Religious Studies, Classical Studies/Classical Philology, Art History.
            The primary focus of this workshop is to explore the narrative material of mythological stories, underlying belief systems, and the multifaceted representation of characters in mythological contexts using digital methods.
            The full-day workshop is targeted at scholars who work on interdisciplinary research questions, which involve mythological (and derivative) topics and the application or development of computer science methods and algorithms.
            We welcome participants from all stages of their academic career, from (under-)graduate students to early career researchers and senior researchers. (<a href="https://dm4myth.github.io">https://dm4myth.github.io</a>)

           This workshop delves into the intersection of cultural practices and the digital sphere through a hands-on exploration of multilingual fiction book reviewing. 
           It offers participants an immersive experience, guiding them through the full research workflow of computational reader response studies, using book reviews and online comments as proxies for reception.
            Scheduled as four sessions, the workshop provides data and addresses key theoretical, methodological, and interpretive challenges to give participants a comprehensive
            understanding of the process. It is particularly suited for early career researchers, while senior researchers are also encouraged to attend and engage in discussions on theory and methodology. 
            Participants will gain practical experience with advanced NLP methods, statistical modeling, and computational approaches to reader response studies. Basic familiarity with Python is recommended.
